MyInHand

MyInHand is a simple, transparent salary calculator that helps you understand where your money actually goes — beyond just CTC.

Instead of hiding calculations behind fixed assumptions, MyInHand lets you edit key salary components and instantly see how they affect your gross salary, deductions, and final in-hand amount.

🔹 Why this exists

Most salary calculators:
• Hide assumptions
• Lock important fields
• Don’t match real salary slips

MyInHand is built to feel close to an actual payslip, while still staying generic and flexible enough to work across different companies and salary structures.

🔹 Tech Stack (for the curious)
